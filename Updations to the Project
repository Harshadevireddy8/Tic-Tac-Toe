Need to add the History Function with MySQL/PostgreSQL

Doing that with the help of Java DataBase Connectivity.

Firstly the format should be like this:

1)Table with 2 Columns.

2)The first-one with Serial Number

3)Second should be the winner it-self with either X or O.

Might also add Count function with leads or with to that point to the user.

beside their Player.
